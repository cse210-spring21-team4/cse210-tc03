## Dalton
I'm originally from Missouri, but have mostly lived in Rexburg Idaho since 2012.
Prior to returning to school this year, I worked as an IT recruiter for O'Reilly Auto Parts. That experience gave me a lot of insight into the field of IT, and helped me narrow down what I wanted to do as a career. I'm now slated to graduate in about a year with a data science degree.
My wife and I have a son who's a little less than two, and a daughter arriving later this semester.
A lot of my hobbies and interests revolve around computers and coding, but I also enjoy reading and the outdoors.
I'm looking forward to working with everyone this semester!
